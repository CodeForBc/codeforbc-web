      "problemStatement": "CodeForBC lacks a dedicated website, which limits its ability to effectively organize events, engage with the community, and showcase its impact. Without a centralized online presence, it's challenging for potential volunteers, participants, and sponsors to find information and connect. A dedicated website would provide a professional hub to enhance visibility, community engagement, and support the organization's growth and effectiveness in solving local challenges.",

        "Develop a User-Friendly Website that clearly communicates CodeBC's mission and values",
